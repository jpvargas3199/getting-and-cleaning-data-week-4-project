# getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-project

The script works in the following way:

1. It downloads and unzips the files
2. It merges both data sets (train and test)
3. It extracts the necessary data for mean and standard deviation
4. It labels with appropiate variable names
5. It cleans and tidy data
6. It creates a second,  independent tidy data set with the avg of each variable for each activity and subject
